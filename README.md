# AssignRef

###Assign Ref is a platform that allows game official's of the Liga de Fútbol Americano Profesional (LFA) to be assigned games, graded based on their performance, tested on their knowledge, and compensated for their work. AssignRef is an MVP and due to the proprietary nature of the code I can only provide code snippets of my code. This repository contains SQL, .NET, and React code.

My role as a software engineer was to implement the functionality of the email service and test taking/tracking. I was required to handle all the coding from the backend to the frontend. Below is a list of the actions I took to accomplish my responsibilities.

● Integrated an email communication system utilizing third-party libraries, such as SendInBlue, to enable smooth exchange of feedback with AssignRef & end-users.

● Designed and implemented a flexible database schema to efficiently manage test questions, answers, and results using Microsoft's SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) for AssignRef admins.

● Constructed RESTful API Controllers in C# using Microsoft's ADO.NET framework to enable efficient data transfer between servers and end-users.

● Designed and developed a user-friendly and adaptable UI for AssignRef administrators using CSS & Bootstrap, simplifying the management of test taking and monitoring results.

● Focused on best practices using proper naming convention and casing to avoid compiler issues with team member’s code.

● Maintained workflow using GitBash and GitHub for repo management.

● Effectively managed Git branches by creating and merging feature branches, resolving conflicts, and ensuring the stability of the main branch using pull requests and code reviews.

● Participated in daily stand-ups, code review, and code talks with team members to ensure cohesive implementation of code.
